# Timeseries-regression-with-fb-Prophet
Time Series forecasting of Champagne sales
Forecasting and fitting of timeseries data using Prophet In this project, we used time series forecasting using prophet. In first step, we exported data and necessary libraries. Then we inspected the data and looked for necessary information. Then we dropped the two columns which were unnecessary and also looked for dupliacated values and null values. there were none found. Next, we corrected the date format and changed into date time. we renamed the columns to ds and y,as fb prophet only need these two variables. In the next step we forecasted for the coming 100 days using prophet model. Then we visualised the data by plotlib. In last we checked the fitness of the model by cross validation and in the end the result is interpreted.
